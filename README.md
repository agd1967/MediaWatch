# MediaWatch
Electronic platform to monitor the Canadian press and its behaviour, in reporting on the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean. This tool will eventually present a sentiment analysis making use of opinion mining, and the trends of the media on the region. 
(Data is collected from the mediaâ€™s search engines, and may not necessarily reflect actual published information.)

It is developed using Python, PHP, HTML5, Javascript and Highcharts. Data is extracted from MySql.

I hope it can help anyone, and also attract constructive criticism and support.
